This repository demonstrates a common but often overlooked error in HTML involving the use of innerHTML. Incorrectly setting the innerHTML property can lead to unexpected behavior, such as overwriting existing content or creating XSS vulnerabilities. The `bug.html` file shows an example of incorrect usage where the whole content is getting replaced; the solution file shows the correct way of appending the content to an element. It also highlights how to avoid potential security issues with user-generated content.
